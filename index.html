<article>Scream(2022) is the fifth installment in the Scream franchise. Twenty-five years after a streak of brutal murders shocked the quiet town of Woodsboro, a new killer has donned the Ghostface mask and begins targeting a group of teenagers to resurrect secrets from the town's brutal past. </article>
<p class="funParagraph">Although it was a fun movie, something about this film felt different than the past Scream movies. Probably because it is the only one not directed by Wes Craven, who directed the past 4, but sadly passed away in 2015. It is easily the most gory of the franchise, so that gets some extra points from me. The new characters introduced are a mixed bag for me, some of them are interesting and well-acted, but some feel like they are characatures of young college kids. Overall I enjoyed the film as it pushed the franchise forward to the next one coming out in the beginning of 2023.</p>

<p class="title2"><b>Terrifier 2</b></p>

<p>The sequel to the low budget love letter to old, grimy, grindhouse films of the 80s and 90s, Terrifier, Terrifier 2 does what the previous film does and more. While the former had little to do with story and characters and mostly focused on practical gore, the latter actually creates compelling characters who you root for while telling a focused and thoughtful story. But, they did not tame the practical effects down, instead they doubled down on them. With one scene in particular that rivals the first films saw scene. The only downside to me was the runtime. A nearly two and a half hour slasher movie is unprecidented and I respect the risk Leone took. Most of the movie still felt like a breeze dispite the runtime, besides the ending. It had multiple fake out death scenes with multiple characters that dragged on too long. Overall, one of my favorite movies of this year, period.</p>

<p id="director"><em>Jordan Peele</em></p>

<p>As with most Jordan Peele films, I had to watch this one multiple times and think it over to really appreciate it. There is a lot of symbolism and forshadowing that is very easily missed on a first watch. But what you don't miss is a compelling story that has multiple twists and turns. And also as usual with a Peele film, the acting is incredible. Kaluuya, Palmer, and Yeun do a great job at playing their respected roles. Visually, it is also stunning, Peele can direct and the CG is particularly done well despite him not using much in his previous two films. Overall, what the film does well it does so excedingly well, maybe I'm a little to dumb to understand everything on the first watch or maybe Peele is a bit pretentious, either way you'll have fun.</p>
